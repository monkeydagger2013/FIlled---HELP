Hi All ! We are a start-up from Toronto. We specialize in bringing artist and studios closer tougher then ever before. Our main problem. We have no experience in both build IOS app or writing code. We would love to know all the necessary  steps needed to take in order to build an IOS app, if anyone has a moment to spare, leave us a quick over view or give us a full detail on how to go about build a brand new IOS app. The App Functionality : Login, Register, Live Feed, Videos, Photo's, Chat, Google Maps, Upload and Download Music, video, photo's etc... Thank You -Stas
